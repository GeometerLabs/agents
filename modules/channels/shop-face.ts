// The customer view's head on the shop's page (plan item 11f, decision 44): the shop's character, its hours this week, "message us on WhatsApp", and the partner's
// small line. Rendered by page.ts on the booking page (in the visitor's language, from what the runtime's offer says and the shop's pages file), plain HTML and an
// inline picture: no script, nothing fetched, so the page's content policy stays "no script".
//
// The character (item 11i): the picture of the mood the public sees now (all well, busy or closed; character.ts publicFace), drawn by DiceBear on the shop's own
// server and saved with the shop (bundle/character/render.ts). The front adds it to the offer as a data: address (front.ts withFace), because the pages load images
// only from data. Its alt text and the line beside it say the mood in words. A shop whose pictures are not drawn yet shows its name and hours without a face: the
// earlier placeholder (a coloured circle with a letter) is gone, by the owner's rule of DiceBear's own drawings only. Placing it in the page's design is the later
// design pass's; this is the minimal placement in the head.
